## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, I am a senior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering with a strong passion for robotics, aerospace, and design. As a member of Combat Robotics @ Cornell, I have led and contributed to multiple projects where I gained experience in design, hands-on engineering, and collaboration. I love being in team environments and working with people with similar passions. I am eager to apply my skills and education to broader projects and pursue a career in this field.
