The Boeing 737 Max incident shows how important ethics are within the engineering industry. It demonstrates the importance of flawed engineering practices and how decision making can lead to catastrophic failures and cause serious harm to others. For the Boeing 737 crashes, the problem arose from its MCAS system, which was a flight control software that was used to compensate for aerodynamic changes on the plane. While MCAS had good intent, its design was flawed as it highly depended on a single angle-of-attack sensor to determine when to activate. If something was wrong with this sensor, MCAS could continuously force the nose of the plane to point downwards. This was a critical failure that led to 2 catastrophic plane crashes, killing many people.

The ethical issues that led to this were deeply rooted in organizational and economic pressures. Boeing faced a lot of competition from Airbus because of its success with the A320neo at the time. To maintain its place in the industry, Boeing prioritized the rapid development of the 737 Max while avoiding changes that add a lot of cost, like increased pilot training and major hardware redesigns. As a result, MCAS was intentionally downplayed in pilot manuals and training materials, and many pilots were unaware of its existence prior to the accidents. This lack of transparency violates ethical principles of informed consent, since pilots were not given the information necessary to safely operate the aircraft.

Boeing’s response after the first crash also raised serious ethical concerns. Despite clear signs that the accident was linked to MCAS, they did not ground the planes, exposing passengers and crews to potential risk. This reflected a reluctance to act, even though public safety should have been the priority. For individual engineers, business pressures played a central role in how technical decisions were ultimately made. Rather than safety concerns driving the design process, considerations related to cost and timelines took priority. Information relevant to system safety was scattered across separate teams, meaning no single group had a complete picture of potential risks. This issue, combined with the management culture, made it hard for engineer concerns to translate into concrete design changes. 

Accountability was also complicated by the FAA allowing Boeing employees to play a central role in certifying the aircraft. While this kind of delegation is common, it created a situation where internal checks were treated as outside oversight. This structure diffused responsibility across both Boeing and the FAA, which weakened external criticism and allowed safety concerns to stay internal rather than being challenged. 

The Boeing 737 Max incident highlights the ethical conflict between profitability and the safety of the public. Engineering codes of ethics from ASME states that engineers must hold paramount the safety and welfare of the public. While business success is important, it can never override this responsibility. The crashes show the real human cost of ethical issues and serve as a reminder that meeting minimum regulatory requirements is not sufficient when there are known serious risks. It is important that we as engineers follow these ethical codes and think about the broader implications of our work. As engineers, we must recognize that our decisions can have real consequences for people’s lives. The Boeing 737 Max crashes show what can happen when safety is compromised in favor of company costs and timelines. This case reinforces the importance of prioritizing public safety and speaking up when engineering decisions create unnecessary risk.
